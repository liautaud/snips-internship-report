### Summary.

This report summarizes my 2018 internship at [Snips](https://snips.ai/) under the supervision of Mathieu Poumeyrol, where I worked on improving the performance and energy-efficiency of https://github.com/sonos/tract, their neural network inference engine for single-board computers and embedded devices. This lead to the design and implementation of a static analyzer and optimizer for TensorFlow graphs, as well as the formalization of streaming semantics for TensorFlow graphs.
